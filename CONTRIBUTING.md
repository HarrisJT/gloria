# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions in the form of ideas, designs, and code are always welcome no matter how large or small. 
If you want to help but are not sure where to start, you can check out our project's 
[Issues](https://github.com/gloriajs/gloria/issues).

For contributing instructions look at this page:

Another great way to get in touch with the contributors, and learn about the future of the project or get
support is to join the slack team. [Request an invite here](http://slack.gloriajs.com/).
